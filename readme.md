# smarkdown
Smarkdown is my attempt to write a token based markdown parser that is fully compatible with [commonmark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2). It is written entirely in Rust without any sub-dependancies.

Smarkdown is in no way ready for use. I've open sourced it purely for those who are interested in seeing my progress.
